# Recomate &mdash; Film suggestion app

## The app is developed with the use of MERN stack technologies

The app can recommend a film that you would most likely enjoy according to either your direct input or, if you have an account, films that you've checked in the app so far. You can check the film's synopsis, cast, genres and trailer.
